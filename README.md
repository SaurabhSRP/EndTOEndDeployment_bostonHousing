# Streamlit App for Diamond Price Prediction
## Overview
- This project has two main objectives.
- First to build a simple Linear regression based ML model showing different steps in building a model such as 
  - Explorartory Data Anaylsis 
  - Working with outliers
  - Standarisation of data
  - Model training and prediction with higher accuracy
  - Pickling the model for re-use
- Second build a simple but interactive **Streamlit** based app which is also deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

## Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/diamonds-prices
- It consists of single CSV file , you can download and start building a model using the same.

## Code and Resources Used
- ***Python Version:*** 3.9
- ***Packages:*** Streamlit
- ***For Web Framework Requirements:*** ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Conclusion 
- The linear regression model works with accuracy equal to 90%.
- We can improve the performance by doing some hyper parameter tuning and also by applying log transformation on the skewed data 
- Here is a  pictures from the web app.
